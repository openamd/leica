LEICAS DREAM
------------

START
-----

In the dist/ directory there are two shell scripts to start the program. 
They only differ in setting different command line arguments.


# dist/run-epc.sh 
-> Runs the program as an undecorated window at the size of 800x480px

# dist/run-production.sh
-> Sets fullscreen mode at a resolution of 1024x768px


Look inside the shell scripts... the second command line argument is the oid of a 
specific sputnik tag. This id will be highlighted in green color.

The program expects (for now) a binary input stream at UDP port 2342.
